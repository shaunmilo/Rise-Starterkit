# Rise-Starterkit

Rise Starterkit is a minimal responsive HTML/CSS template, based on <a href="http://rwdgrid.com/">RWD Grid</a>, intended to help get small projects off the ground quicker and easier.

This template also utilizes <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>.

<h2>Quick Guide</h2>

All base template styles are located in rise.sass. Any additional styles can be created in style.sass.

This is a class-based template that uses several identifying CSS classes that can be modified and re-used, such as:

<h3>.info-box</h3>
Used to contain informative content blurbs.

<h3>.hero</h3>
The main top banner/hero image.

<h3>.sidekick</h3>
The second, less powerful banner section. ;)

<h3>.button</h3>
Button styling to be used throughout.

<h3>.gutter</h3>
Creates even spacing between columns without breaking the grid.
